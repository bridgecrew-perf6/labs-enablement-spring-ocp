## Step 7

We have deployed applications using ``oc`` commands. This approach will work for basic development but on the long run, this approach won't be efficient and maintainable.

Alternative/standard methods to deploy applications:

1. Using Yamls
2. ``helm`` - Standard package manager for k8s

## Generating YAMLs from existing applications

#### 1. Cluster Part
```
% oc get projects/dev-apps -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/cluster-resources/project.yaml
```
#### 2. Build Part
```
oc get bc/springbootapp -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/build-config/buildconfig.yaml
oc get is/openjdk -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/build-config/is_openjdk.yaml
oc get is/springbootapp -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/build-config/is_springbootapp.yaml
```

#### 3. Application Part
```
% oc get deployment/springbootapp -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/deployment.yaml
% oc get svc/springbootapp -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/service.yaml
```

#### 4. Application Config Part
```
% oc get configmap/springbootapp-config -o yaml  > simple-microservice/deployment/app-deployment/configmap.yaml 

% oc get svc/springbootapp -o yaml > simple-microservice/deployment/app-deployment/service.yaml
```

These yamls can be parameterised and generalized in-form of helm charts and library charts for easy governance.
