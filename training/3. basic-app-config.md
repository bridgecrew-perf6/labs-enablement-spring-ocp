## Step 3

In Step #1, we have deployed the application with the default configuration defined inside the application jar file. 

Now let's try to deploy the application by passing the required configuration by:

  1. Passing -e environment option during app creation
  2. Using configmaps 


### 2.1 Specifying configuration during app creation

It is possible to set key-value pair properties when we create the new application (deployment) using the ``oc new-app`` command

Let's create a new application with the property ``app.name=test`` set and environment variable

```
oc new-app  --name springbootapp-2 springbootapp -e app.name=test -l deployment=springboot-2

--> Found image 8da88b4 (2 hours old) in image stream "dev-apps/springbootapp" under tag "latest" for "springbootapp"


--> Creating resources with label deployment=springboot-2 ...
    imagestreamtag.image.openshift.io "springbootapp-2:latest" created
    deployment.apps "springbootapp-2" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.

```

#### Testing the configuration

Now lets test the new application using the ``/appname`` endpoint. This endpoint must return the value we had set for the key ``app.name`` in the property which is ``test``.

Test:
```
% oc get pods -l deployment=springbootapp-2
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
springbootapp-2-79f64d85b7-5d55r   1/1     Running   0          3m4s
% oc port-forward pod/springbootapp-2-79f64d85b7-5d55r 9000:8100

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9000 -> 8100
Forwarding from [::1]:9000 -> 8100
```

**In a new window**

```
% curl localhost:9000/appname
test%
```
Now the output has changed to ``test`` instead of ``myapp`` 

### 2.2 Using Config Maps

ConfigMaps are Kubernetes native objects which are used to store properties as key-value pairs. It is possible to store the key-value pairs as files which can be inturn mounted as volumes inside the application pods.

Unlike ``-e`` option, it is easier to have a long list of key-value pairs in configmap and add this keys to the deployment(/app). Let's try this out.

#### 2.2.1 Creating config map

We can create a config map from:


1. A list of key-value pairs
   
      ```
      oc create configmap springbootapp-config --from-literal=app.name=config-map-app --from-literal=anotherkey=anothervalue
      ```
    
  Verify the configmap contents:

    ```
     oc describe configmap/springbootapp-config
      Name:         springbootapp-config
      Namespace:    dev-apps
      Labels:       <none>
      Annotations:  <none>

      Data
      ====
      anotherkey:
      ----
      anothervalue
      app.name:
      ----
      config-map-app
    ```
2. Using existing properties file (like application.properties)
 
      ```
      oc create configmap springbootapp-configs  --from-file=application.properties

      configmap/springbootapp-configs created
      ```
    Verify the configmap contents:
      ```
      oc describe configmap/springbootapp-configs
      Name:         springbootapp-configs
      Namespace:    dev-apps
      Labels:       <none>
      Annotations:  <none>

      Data
      ====
      application.properties:  
      ----
      server.port=8100
      spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
      spring.application.name=simple-microservice
      Events:  <none>
     ```

<i> Notice the data section of the file based configmap. We can see the source file name as well.  </i>

#### 2.2.1 Attaching config maps to deployments

It is really easy to attach the configuration to an existing application using the ``oc set env`` command. 


```
% oc set env --from=configmap/springbootapp-config deployment/springbootapp
deployment.apps/springbootapp updated
```

After we update the env, the application will get restarted automatically for the changes to take effect.
####Testing the config update


```
% oc get pods -l app=springbootapp
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
springbootapp-5b8764dc6b-rf5pb   1/1     Running   0          85s

% oc port-forward pods/springbootapp-5b8764dc6b-rf5pb 9000:8100

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9000 -> 8100
Forwarding from [::1]:9000 -> 8100

In another terminal window:

% curl localhost:9000/appname
config-map-app%
```

Verify that the appname is now ``config-map-app`` instead of default ``myapp``

Hurray! we have learned the basics of config maps and how it can be attached to the kubernetes workloads(/ apps)

Upcoming examples will show how to mount the configmaps as files inside the pods.
