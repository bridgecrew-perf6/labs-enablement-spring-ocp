## Step 2

In Step #1, we have deployed the application with the default configuration defined inside the application jar file. 

Before we proceed, lets test the deployed application by port forwarding. Port forwarding is a technique to access the services deployed on the cluster from local machine.

### Get the name of the pod name:

```
oc get pod -l app=springbootapp
```

Output:


NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
``springbootapp-5888bf98f6-rhrrr``  1/1     Running   0          39m

### Forward a local port to the above pod
```
oc port-forward pod/springbootapp-5888bf98f6-rhrrr 9000:8100

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9000 -> 8100
Forwarding from [::1]:9000 -> 8100

```

where
  9000 is the local port 
  8100 is the remote port on to which the pod is listening to

### Testing the app

Open a new terminal to test the service we have created:

```
 curl localhost:9000/appname
myapp%

```

 where 

  9000 is the local port which forwards the request to remote pod's port 8100

  `myapp` is the default value configured the service.

**Application code:**

  ```
  	@Value("${app.name:myapp}")
	private String applicationName;
  ```

All the configuration examples will update the property key ``app.name`` for demonstration.

### Scaling apps

Its is relatively easy in k8s to scale the apps based on the cpu/mem consumption


#### Manual scaling

```
 oc scale deployments/springbootapp-configmap-example --replicas 2
```
#### Auto Scaling

```
    oc autoscale deployments/springbootapp-configmap-example --min 3 --max 5 --cpu-percent=75 #hpa
```

#### Scaling for stateful apps

  Scaling for stateful is managed by VPA operator.
